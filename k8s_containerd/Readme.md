## How to use this
1. Assuming that vagrant provisioner is installed and Virtualbox is also installed, then simply run bellow command:

```console
vagrant up
```

In about 10 minutes a Kubernetes cluster with one K8S master and 3 nodes should be created.
If you need a different number of nodes, adjust the variable N in vagrant file with whatever value you need:

"N = 3"
